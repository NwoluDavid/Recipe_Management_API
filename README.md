## Overview

The Recipe Management API is a FastAPI-based application designed to simplify the management of recipes. It provides endpoints to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on recipes. With this API, users can retrieve recipes, add new recipes, update existing recipes, and delete recipes from the database.

## Features

- **Retrieve Recipes**: Get a list of all available recipes or retrieve a specific recipe by its title.
- **Add New Recipes**: Create and add new recipes to the database.
- **Update Recipes**: Modify existing recipes with new information.
- **Delete Recipes**: Remove recipes from the database.

2. Install dependencies:

   ```

3. Run the FastAPI server:
